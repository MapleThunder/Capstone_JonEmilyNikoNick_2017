Repository for our Capstone project.

Once you clone the repository, you will need to install composer and
generate a key. Follow these steps:

- Copy/Paste you '.env.example' file into the same directory
- Name the new file just '.env'
- Open the terminal in PhpStorm with [Alt + F12] 
- Type 'composer install' and hit Enter
- When that is finished type 'php artisan key:generate'
