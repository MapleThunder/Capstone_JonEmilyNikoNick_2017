                        <p>
                            Emily was born and raised in Ottawa, ON, Canada and moved to Halifax, NS in 2009 to attend
                            Dalhousie University. She graduated in 2014 with a degree in Spanish & Latin American Studies.
                            After university, she worked for a while before deciding to return to school to gain better
                            skills for a career. After suggestions to try an online coding tutorial, which she thoroughly
                            enjoyed, she decided to attend the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) for Information Technology.
                            She found her database courses most interesting and chose Database Analytics Development as her concentration.
                            Emily will graduate from the IT program in the spring of 2017 with a full-time job
                            lined up at IBM. She is excited to begin her career in development.
