                        <p>
                            Emily was born and raised in Ottawa, ON, Canada and moved to Halifax, NS in 2009 to attend
                            Dalhousie University. She graduated in 2014 with a degree in Spanish & Latin American Studies.
                            After university, she worked for a while before deciding to return to school to gain better
                            skills for a career. After suggestions to try an online coding tutorial, which she thoroughly
                            enjoyed, she decided to attend the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) for Information Technology.
                            She found her database courses most interesting and chose Database Analytics Development as her concentration.
                            Emily will graduate from the IT program in the spring of 2017 with a full-time job
                            lined up at IBM. She is excited to begin her career in development.

                        Niko was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He has had an interest in computers from a
                        young age. His first foray into programming was in elementary where he taught himself simple HTML
                        to be able to change the look of text on the Neopets forums, and he brought this interest with
                        him throughout his schooling. After working for a few years after high school Niko was suggested
                        by a friend to go to NSCC and take the IT program. The generalized first year helped him to get
                        a feeling for the different aspects of IT. His database and programming classes stood out the
                        most to him so he chose the Database Analytics Developer concentration. Niko will graduate in June
                        of 2017 with a full time position at Bluelight Analytics.
